# UFOGame
A spin on the game "Hangman" and the 2019 Software Engineer Internship Backend Programming Challenge from Codecademy. 

First, the game outputs instructions and an art of the player's "friend" being abducted. The program prompts the user to enter a letter in order to guess a codeword.

The player will continue to guess, and the program keeps track of the user's answer in a string, as well as incorrect guesses in a vector.

Ideally, the player will solve the codeword and save their friend.
